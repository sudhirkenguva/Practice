tips: 
--> practice every day (atleast 2 hours) [actually by practicing every day and managing time, we can do many things]
--> when you frustrate with stuff, take it slow (dont worry)
--> its alright to lost early (if you dont get things, try to stick with them)
--> when you get stuck, get more information
--> try to solve things on your own first (before asking someone help, first try to be)
--> Finally good luck and have fun.
