Docker is used to deploy the applications not the machines.

Docker uses a client/server architecture. The server uses the Docker engine to cache images, run and manage containers, handle logs and much more.

Key Terms: 
    A Dockerfile is the source code.
    An image is the binary resulting from compiling and building your Dockerfile.
    A container is the running instance of an image, a process by all means.
    Images are cached and containers are run by a Docker host (a machine running the Docker engine) [need to understand]
    Images are stored in a public registry [like npm, apt, pip etc]
